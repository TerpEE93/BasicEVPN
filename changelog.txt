### 17 March 2017
- Fixed dcf_spine.j2 template
  o Template incorrectly assigned .11 as the host part of the IRB IP address
    for all Spines.  Needs to be node_id, so it's unique per Spine.

  o Changed the host part of the IP address on the Spine link to the Edge
    from a .1 to a .2.  This is more consistent with the "bigger end gets
    the lower address" convention we used with the Spines and Leafs.

- Rewrote several policies for importing and exporting routes inside the DC
  o Also added OVERLAY and UNDERLAY communities to help with this

- Added policy for exchanging routes with the DC edge router

- Added BGP peering to DC edge router
  o Applies policies in previous note

- Added vrf-table-label to the vrf routing-instances configuration on
  the Spine switches.  We need this before the Spines will advertise the
  IRB networks to the edge routers.

- Added an OVERLAY-LEAF-EXPORT policy and vpn-apply-export to the dc_leaf.j2
  template so that we can advertise EVPN routes with the OVERLAY community
  set at the source.
